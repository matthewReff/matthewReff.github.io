	<h1>Projects/Interests </h1>
	<h2>Competitive Programming - Kattis</h2>
	<p>Kattis is a competitive programming practice website, for which I've taken a particular liking. As of time of writing I am in the top 250 users out of many thousands. This respostory holds my solutions for problems, and I often come back to check what a previous thought process was. The problems are primarily solved using C++ and Python with it all being tied together by a large number of shell scripts.</p>

	<h2>Competitive Programming - CodeForces</h2>
	<p>Codeforces is a competitive programming practice website, which I have used far less than Kattis. Their tightly time limited contest structure is very different from what I am used to, but I am certainly trying to get better. The problems have a fundamentally different feel from Kattis and usually have signifigantly less fluff/context around the problem. As with Kattis, problems are solved primarily in C++ with the occasional problem in Python.</p>

	<h2>6502 Emulator </h2>
	<p>Project for Computer Organisation and Archiecture(COA). Emulates assembly instruction input/execution for the 6502 processor. The emulator features a fairly intense suite of tests and attempts to have good layering between functionality as much as possible.</p>

	<h2>Locket Match Queries - WIP</h2>
	<p>Pulls data from Valve's API and stores to a local MySQL database which is then used to give detailed information about players. Exisitng stats webstie can give information about how a professional teams plays together or on indivual ametuer players. This program would allow checking up on non professional teams in leagues like CSL and AD2L with the same detail that existing website would give for professionals. This project uses Clojure for API calls and data processing, with storage and retreival being done with SQL</p>

	<h2>Chronological Notes for Fantasy Calandars - WIP</h2>
	<p>Windows application meant to keep track of dates and unique time systems for tabletop games. This gave me a good chance to practice TDD and Azure CI. It uses C# for logic code and XAML/WPF for GUI.</p>
